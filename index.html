              <p class="about-me-txt">
                Hello! I’m Lucah. I’m originally from Ohio, but currently reside in the San Francisco Bay Area. I’m an extreme lover of music, cartoons, cooking, illustration/ screen printing .. really anything art related is my thing. However, my first job in high school was at the local pizza shop and I had continued working in restaurants and cafes for over 10 years! 
              </p>
              <p class="about-me-txt">
                All of my restaurant experiences have been centered around being part of a team, which has motivated me to step up and be a leader. I worked my way up in the scene and had the opportunity to become part of team leading and management. I live to lift people up and thrive off of setting the tone for a positive culture and environment that ultimately leads to a successful, motivated, hard working team. 
              </p>
              <p class="about-me-txt">
                While the restaurant scene has been wonderful to me, I decided it was time for a change. I’ve always been extremely artistic, so I was thinking to myself, “ how could I best apply this to a career?” I’ve always had an interest in advertising and graphic design, specifically gearing towards web design. Being in the Bay Area has really opened my eyes up to the tech industry and all it has to offer. I suddenly started realizing just how artistic programming can be. You have the opportunity to not only design applications, but create them yourself inside and out. Being a creator myself, you can imagine how appealing this is! I decided to take the leap and learn. I believe combining my inner creator with all of my teamwork and leadership experience, will undoubtedly fuel me toward success in this industry.
