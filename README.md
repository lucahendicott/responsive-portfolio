# Responsive Portfolio 

## Project Description

This Project is my responsive portfolio, utilizing Bootstrap along with some custom CSS for styling. There are 3 different pages you can navigate to using the nav bar. The pages include an about me, a portflio page and a contact page. Any user can easily navigate through each page. The About Me page has detailed information and links to github and linkedin, including contact info. The Portfolio page has cards which display some projects with photos and links to the repos and deployed apps.

## Cool stuff I learned

I learned how to link all of my HTML pages in the nav-link classes, so that all the nav buttons on the deployed site function properly, directing you to the correct corresponding pages. I also learned how to create a custom contact card and modify the 'submit' button with some custom CSS. That said, I also learned how to overwrite some of Bootstraps standard styling with my own style.css file. This included changing some margins, padding and some background colors, which I used Google's dev tools to help get an idea of where they were at and what I wanted them to look like. I was also able to attach a sticky footer to each page successfully.
