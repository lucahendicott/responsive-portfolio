## Responsive Portfolio

This Project is my responsive portfolio, utilizing Bootstrap along with some custom CSS for styling. There are 3 different pages you can navigate to using the nav bar. The pages include an about me, a portflio page and a contact page.

I learned how to link all of my HTML pages in the nav-link classes, so that all the nav buttons on the deployed site function properly, directing you to the correct corresponding pages. I also learned how to create a custom contact card and modify the 'submit' button with some custom CSS. That said, I also learned how to overwrite some of Bootstraps standard styling with my own style.css file. This included changing some margins, padding and some background colors, which I used Google's dev tools to help get an idea of where they were at and what I wanted them to look like.

You'll find some photos on the portfolio page. I learned how to use a "portfolio" class to get a nice layout of the photos. I also learned how to properly link an img in my HTMl by saving it in my assets folder and sourcing it through its relative path.
