# Responsive Portfolio

## Project Description

This Project is my responsive portfolio, utilizing Bootstrap along with some custom CSS for styling. There are 3 different pages you can navigate to using the nav bar. The pages include an about me, a portflio page and a contact page.

## Cool stuff I learned

I learned how to link all of my HTML pages in the nav-link classes, so that all the nav buttons on the deployed site function properly, directing you to the correct corresponding pages. I also learned how to create a custom contact card and modify the 'submit' button with some custom CSS. That said, I also learned how to overwrite some of Bootstraps standard styling with my own style.css file. This included changing some margins, padding and some background colors, which I used Google's dev tools to help get an idea of where they were at and what I wanted them to look like.

You'll find some photos on the portfolio page. I learned how to use a "portfolio" class to get a nice layout of the photos. I also learned how to properly link an img in my HTMl by saving it in my assets folder and sourcing it through its relative path.

Here are some screenshots of what the responsive portfolio looks like when deployed on a browser
